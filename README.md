# Cereal Engine
### PROJECT TIMELINE IS AT THE BOTTOM
## Introduction
Cereal Engine is a 3D + 2D game engine written in C++ live on [my twitch channel!](https://www.twitch.tv/DaSerialGenius).  I actually have no clue how to make a game engine, so I'm making it up as I go along, but as long as I'm making progress who cares right? I'm hoping to have a nice little almost usable thing going by next year April. I'm the only one working on this as I am learning how to make the game engine as I go along. 

It has an Entity Component System, A basic Input System, Mesh Rendering and an OBJ loader already with a bunch more features on the way. You can check out the progress on my [Trello Board!](https://trello.com/b/Dpa4KPCD/cereal-engine-progress-tracker)

## Project Timeline
The project is being developed in my livestreams over at [my twitch!](https://www.twitch.tv/DaSerialGenius) You can also check out the older stuff on this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi8sYAtVw4hYDBsHXkp2sO-ULponI6s0e) You can really tell how much I've grown as a programmer in these short streams!

- **Day #1:** [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQH39y_mFAg&list=PLi8sYAtVw4hYDBsHXkp2sO-ULponI6s0e&index=1) - I got a window running with SDL and a GL Context as well as set up GLAD

- **Day #2:** [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzZp3_YcMFw&list=PLi8sYAtVw4hYDBsHXkp2sO-ULponI6s0e&index=2) - I made a shader class and get a Triangle on the screen!

- **Day #3:** [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6t9bcB4Vmo&list=PLi8sYAtVw4hYDBsHXkp2sO-ULponI6s0e&index=3) - Here I make a Mesh Class and use it to render a cube (We see only one side but it is indeed a square!)

- **Day #4:** [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPXHCvx2KYc&list=PLi8sYAtVw4hYDBsHXkp2sO-ULponI6s0e&index=4) - I made the object loader so that I can load in any OBJ file I like!

- **Day #5:** [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zh1QpPTTsIA&list=PLi8sYAtVw4hYDBsHXkp2sO-ULponI6s0e&index=5) - **[Huge jump in quality alert!]** I fixed a huge bug that I found out later that was causing issues with how things were being rendered.

- **Day #6:** [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hXHWsfi4Vw&list=PLi8sYAtVw4hYDBsHXkp2sO-ULponI6s0e&index=7) - I implemented an Entity Component System similar to the one that is in Unity.

- **Day #7:** [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4peaR7EfjA&list=PLi8sYAtVw4hYDBsHXkp2sO-ULponI6s0e&index=8) - I made a nice little input system that takes in keyboard and mouse states. 

- **Day #8a:** [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrXhpWFcUjo&list=PLi8sYAtVw4hYDBsHXkp2sO-ULponI6s0e&index=9) - I forgot to make deltaTime so I added that here now!

- **Day #8b:** [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whv6VqDVaIQ&list=PLi8sYAtVw4hYDBsHXkp2sO-ULponI6s0e&index=10) - I made a working camera, except it only moves its position right now. Rotation added in the very next stream!

- **Day #9:** [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUu3hy6vkls&list=PLi8sYAtVw4hYDBsHXkp2sO-ULponI6s0e&index=11) - I figured out how camera rotations works finally!

- **Day #10:** [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQg-kdZBHSE&list=PLi8sYAtVw4hYDBsHXkp2sO-ULponI6s0e&index=12) - Made a nice little textured cube!
